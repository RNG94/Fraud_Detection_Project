# Fraud_Detection_Project

ðŸš€ Hey, great news! I've made significant progress on my credit card fraud detection project using machine learning! ðŸŽ‰

Project aim: Predict fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and Artificial Neural Networks.

Addressing imbalanced data challenge: Implemented techniques to handle imbalanced data, ensuring balanced training datasets and improved predictions.

Exploring new possibilities: Explored FLAML - AutoML Library for automated model selection. Discovered LightGBM - AutoML as a valuable addition to my ensemble.

User-friendly deployment: Deployed the final model with Streamlit API for an intuitive and interactive interface. Real-time predictions can be accessed here.

Stay tuned for updates as I refine and enhance my project! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to learn more about machine learning and data science.
